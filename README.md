# Horiseon Code Refactor 

## Description

Code refactoring is a very important skill to have in the process of working on code for a client. Not only does it help to avoid redundant coding, it also makes future code modifications much more streamlined. While the Horiseon website had baseline functionality, there was a good amount of code refactoring needed to optimize the web page. Both the HTML and CSS needed refactoring, and that is exactly what we did. I believe the client will be very happy with the final product.
